Dear Emperor,

I bought a gamer keyboard in the new online store of the Galactic Company of Computer Devices (GCCD) last month. After  using it for a month, I’m amazed. The touch of the keys and the responde time are unbeatable. 

However, I’m writing this letter to suggest some changes in order to improve some features of the Company. Delivery was great, and the product arrived in perfect condicions, but in my opinion it took too long to receive it. In addition, I think that the information about the products that is available on the website is insufficient. Improving this aspect would be key to help costumers to make the right decision before buying a product.

With this suggestions, the Compan, which offers very good products, could grow in the market and expands its customers base, even reaching the edge of the Galaxy. 

Thanking You,

Yours truly,

Pablo Giner.
